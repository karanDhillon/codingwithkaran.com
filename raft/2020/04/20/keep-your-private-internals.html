    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Java</code> default visibility modifier for its elements is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">protected</code>. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Protected</code> means that those elements have package level visibility, which in turn means only elements in the same package are allowed to use the element marked with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">protected</code> visibility modifier. This made sure that your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">classes</code> present in a different package cannot accidently use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">class</code> from a different package. But here walks in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Kotlin</code>, making the elements default visibility modifier <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">public</code>. Sounds like a small change, but its not. It’s a major change. A change which can cause havoc if you are not cautious with the way you are exposing your elements.First let me explain why <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kotlin</code> did what <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kotlin</code> did.</p>

<p>You see back in the days when <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kotlin</code> was a new release, their default visibility modifier was indeed <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">protected</code>. Well it is actually called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">internal</code>, but it does the same thing. Marking a element <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">internal</code> means only files from the same module can access this element marked with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">internal</code>. Now that was a good java-to-kotlin mapping, as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kotlin</code> always try to present itself as “the shorthand Java”. But then something happened. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Kotlin</code> team at JetBrains started noticing a trend. They noticed that most of the users were ditching the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">internal</code> modifier and switching it to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">public</code> modifier. This trend has to be a major spike because later they decided that they are making a change where the default visibility modifier is now going to be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">public</code>. Their reasoning behind this change was that they want <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kotlin</code> to be a language which makes user type less for more. In order to do that and to not cause their customers this annoying switch from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">internal</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">public</code>, they made <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">public</code> the new default. Now lets see this from the perspective of developers who are actually the customers and see how it harms us.</p>

<p>The biggest mistake that was ever made in the IT industry was the invention of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NULL</code>. Even the inventor of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NULL</code> has said on multiple occasions that it was his biggest mistake. On a side note, I personally do not let <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NULL</code> creep into my projects. I rather make an “Empty Object”, which can be used instead of marking anything as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">null</code>. Let’s get back on track though, that mistake was made by a person. Second biggest mistake in IT industry is unseen dependencies. These dependencies creep up in your code and makes change difficult. So it is the job of a developer to manage these dependencies and make sure only certain classes are exposed as part of a module’s public API as dependencies. This will at least make sure that there are certain number of exposures and make debugging faster. Now imagine if by default, you were given the feature where a class cannot be exposed by a different module, or the dependency cannot creep out of your module and then taken away. That has what happened in the case of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kotlin</code>. For example, let us say I make a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Validator</code> class in my Domain layer. Technically, this <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Validator</code> class should only be used by the UseCase. But because <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Kotlin</code> is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">public</code> by default, I would have to remember explicitly to mark this <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Validator</code> class <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">internal</code>. This explicit marking of class as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">internal</code> is actually more annoying because you know that is how it should be by default. Before extending a class you have to explicitly mark it <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">open</code> in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kotlin</code>, so why not to use it in a different module as well. I have my doubts about why at one side we are enforcing something and on another we are easing things. Developers should be made aware of all their decisions, so if they mark a class <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">public</code> they know the dangers that come with it.</p>
